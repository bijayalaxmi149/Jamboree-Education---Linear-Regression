# **🎓 Jamboree Education - Graduate Admissions Analysis**

🚀 Dive into the world of graduate admissions with our comprehensive case study on predicting the probability of admission into Ivy League colleges! Using the "Jamboree-Education---Linear-Regression" dataset, we explore key factors influencing graduate admissions and provide data-driven insights to optimize student success.

## 📄 Project Overview

Jamboree has a track record of guiding students toward top international universities. This project focuses on analyzing the factors that impact graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. By leveraging descriptive analytics and linear regression models, we aim to understand the significance of various factors and predict the likelihood of admission.

## 🛠️ Key Analysis Points

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- **Dataset Profiling**: Overview of the dataset structure, including variable types and characteristics.
- **Non-Graphical and Graphical Analysis**: Distribution analysis of variables such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, GPA, and more.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between independent variables.

**2. Linear Regression Modeling:**

- **Model Building**: Using the Statsmodel library for linear regression to predict the "Chance of Admit" based on other factors.
- **Assumption Testing**:
  - **Multicollinearity Check**: Evaluating VIF scores.
  - **Residual Analysis**: Checking the mean of residuals, linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics include MAE, RMSE, R², and Adjusted R².

**3. Actionable Insights & Recommendations:**

Providing strategic insights based on the analysis to help Jamboree enhance their admission prediction model and offer personalized guidance to prospective students.
